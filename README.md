## CUDA Explorations

### About this repo:
This repository is my personal space to explore CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) by NVIDIA, which allows for efficient parallel programming on GPUs. 
It will help me:
- **Track progress**: I'll keep pushing new exercises, tutorials, and code samples here to see how I evolve in CUDA programming.
- **Document learning**: For each tutorial or concept I study, Iâ€™ll add notes and explanations to reinforce my understanding.
- **Build a portfolio**: Eventually, this will showcase my CUDA projects and experiments.

### Why CUDA?
I began this journey with these goals in mind:
- To understand the basics of parallel computing.
- To explore the potential of GPU programming for speed improvements.
- To experiment with real-world applications of CUDA in performance-intensive fields like scientific simulations.
- To establish a solid foundation in high-performance computing techniques.
